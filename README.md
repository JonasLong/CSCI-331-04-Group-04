# Title of the Project

## Abstract
This project generates a random sudoku board and solves it, using both a naieve Depth-First-Search algorithm and a more advanced search that uses Constraint Satisfaction Problem to prune invalid states with backtracking and forward checking

## Developers
Jonas Long:
board/cell classes, grid randomization, col/row/group neighbors, board validation, naieve algorithm, backtracking

Justin Guidry:
made simple backtracking with set board, implemented forward checking, optimizations

## How to run the project
run `python main.py`
